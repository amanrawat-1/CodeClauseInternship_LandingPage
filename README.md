# CodeClauseInternship_LandingPage

# This was an allocated task by CodeClause. So I made a website on "Explore Uttarakhand" using HTML, CSS & Javascript.
# It took me a while to think and design this, also its a first website I ever made.
# Got stuck in between countless times. Youtube, Google, GPT helped me out there!!!
# However, this is not responsive yet, But surely I'll make it in coming days.

# Keep Learning!
# Road to Fullstack!!
